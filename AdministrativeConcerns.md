### dbid and the Raima database ###

p 250

#### We concluded the topic with the sentence: ####

_We leave the topic of dbids on these findings without a satisfactory solution for v7.0_

#### Let's add: ####

One can use the _dbid:_ prefix with either decimal or hexadecimal values in various context, e.g. with _describe_ or with _dump_. Note that the _dbid_ value is local to the replica, contrarily to the _oid_ one.
